# My automation topic, why I chose It & how it relates to me.

I'm Adaeze Udeh, a first-year Health Informatics student with a passion for blending health with technology. In my journey of exploration and learning, I embarked on an exciting automation project – the creation of a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator.

**What is BMI?**

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical measure of an individual's body fat based on their weight and height. Widely used in healthcare, it quickly assesses whether a person has a healthy body weight. BMI is crucial for identifying potential health risks associated with being underweight or overweight, serving as a screening tool for conditions like obesity-related diseases and providing a basis for discussions about lifestyle and health.

Diving into the world of health informatics, I found the concept of BMI fascinating and saw an opportunity to contribute to health awareness through automation.

My fascination with BMI lies not only in its numerical representation but in its profound impact on an individual's health. In an era where lifestyle-related diseases are on the rise, having a tangible and efficient means to assess and monitor our health becomes imperative.

My passion for health advocacy fuels my commitment to developing an automated BMI tool. This project aims to bridge the gap between technology and personal health, offering a user-friendly solution that goes beyond mere numbers. Understanding that individuals who fall into the obese category are at a higher risk of developing health conditions like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, being underweight can also be a precursor to various health challenges, ranging from nutritional deficiencies to weakened immune systems. I am driven to provide a tool that empowers people to take charge of their health.

The envisioned automated BMI tool seeks to be a quick, accessible, and accurate resource for individuals to determine their health status promptly. By leveraging automation, the goal is to streamline the process, making it easier for people to make informed decisions about their lifestyles. I envision a future where technology actively contributes to disease prevention, fostering a society that prioritizes and values holistic well-being.

In essence, my choice of the BMI automation project is a testament to my commitment to creating meaningful solutions that resonate with real-life health challenges. Through this endeavor, I aspire to contribute to a healthier, more informed society where individuals have the tools they need to make proactive choices for their well-being.

# Blog Post 2: The Coding Journey

**Introduction:**

As we continue our journey into the development of Ada's BMI Calculator, we transition from the inspiring idea phase to the heart of the project—the coding journey. In this phase, the conceptual vision transforms into a functional tool ready to empower users with valuable health insights.

**Development Tools:**

Choosing the right tools for the development process is crucial. My BMI calculator was crafted using a combination of HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. The decision to opt for these technologies stemmed from their compatibility, versatility, and widespread use, ensuring a seamless user experience across various platforms.
HTML provided the foundation, structuring the content and layout. CSS, with its styling capabilities, added the visually appealing touch to the user interface. JavaScript brought interactivity to the table, allowing dynamic calculations and user-specific information display.
The choice of these technologies not only aligns with industry standards but also reflects a commitment to delivering a user-friendly and accessible BMI calculator.

**BMI Calculation Formula:**

At the core of my BMI calculator lies the BMI calculation formula. The mathematical equation used is BMI = weight / (height \* height). This formula, widely accepted for its simplicity and effectiveness, calculates the BMI value based on user-provided weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).

**How to use Ada's BMI calculator:**

Using my BMI calculator is a straightforward process that analyzes inputted weight and height for BMI assessment. To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Access the Calculator: To access my BMI calculator, simply use the link: https://23w-gbac.github.io/udehadaeze/

2. Gender Selection: Upon reaching the website, select your gender.

3. Input Weight and Height: Enter your weight in kilograms and your height in centimeters into the designated fields.

4. Calculation: Press the "Calculate" button and patiently wait for your result.

5. Result Categorization: Once the calculation is complete, you will be placed into one of five BMI categories & you would be shown specific content Information depending on the BMI category you fall into.

**Challenges Faced,Solutions and Optimizations:**

Embarking on the coding journey inevitably presented challenges. From crafting complex algorithms for BMI categorization to addressing unexpected issues during the implementation phase, every challenge was an opportunity to refine and enhance the BMI calculator.
I implemented innovative solutions to ensure a seamless user experience. Algorithmic refinements were made to enhance the accuracy of the BMI categorization.
Regular code reviews played a pivotal role in identifying areas for improvement. Continuous optimization became a guiding principle, reflecting on my commitment to delivering a top-tier BMI calculator.

**Some of the notable challanges I faced during my Automation include the following:**

1. Input Validation:

For my first challange, Ensuring that users input a numeric value was essential. I implemented input validation using the type="number" attribute in HTML <input> tags. This attribute restricts user input to numeric values, and the required attribute ensures users provide a value for the input fields.

2. Handling GitHub Pages Linking:

Another challenge I encountered was linking both my index.html file (BMI calculator website) and my automationBlog.md to GitHub Pages. Initially, GitHub Pages displayed only the content of my index.html file. To address this, I needed a way to link both files so that when users are on my BMI calculator website and click the "Automation Blog" link, the page automatically redirects them to my GitHub repository. I solved this problem by creating a blog.html file, which is linked to my index.html. This allows users to access my automation blog post directly from my website.

3. Result Precision Control:

I noticed that my BMI calculator was printing results having numerous decimal places. To address this, I wanted the result to have no more than one decimal value. I used toFixed(1) in my JavaScript to limit the result to one decimal place.
![fixed2](https://github.com/23W-GBAC/udehadaeze/assets/148863379/2d344c1a-f71e-4368-94e1-920c8aed34c0)

4.Centering Website Content:

Centering the content of my website posed a challenge. I resolved this by incorporating a container class in my CSS file. The .container class, with max-width and margin: 20px auto; properties, ensures the horizontal centering of content, providing a clean and organized layout.
![container](https://github.com/23W-GBAC/udehadaeze/assets/148863379/893c09bc-6a7f-4d4c-bfa9-49f35884df8a)

**Testing Phase:**

Before conclusion of the project, a testing phase was essential. This involved comprehensive testing of the BMI calculation logic, user interface responsiveness, and the accuracy of category assignments.
This played a vital role, leading to refinements and further enhancements. The iterative testing process not only ensured the reliability of results but also allowed me to incorporate valuable insights.
