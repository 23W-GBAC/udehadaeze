<h3>What is the body mass index (BMI)?</h3>
The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.

<br>For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18.5 to 24.9 range.</br>

 <br><b>BMI Range :</B></br>
<ol>
     <li>below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range</li>
     <li>between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range</li>
     <li>between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range</li>
     <li>between 30 or 39.9 – you're in the obese range</li>
